Data Management plan for the research project The effect of the seed quality 

Context:
X-ray is ionizing radiation. It can cause seed mutation. In the early days, X-rays were used in mutation breeding. In fact, X-rays do induce mutations in seeds if a high dose of hard X-rays is used. Dormant seeds are less easy to mutation because the cells are not dividing and chromosomes are coiled. When you soak the seeds the cells start to divide and X-rays at lower doses can induce mutations and physiological damage as well. This at doses more than 50 Gy but depends on the species. For this research, it has two seed lots peach and one seed lot pear. I will plan 6 experiments, Test 1. Testing the TZ rate of peach and pear for seed quality. Test 2. Initial germination test for the normal seedling. Test3. initial germination test for the 160kv exposure seed. Test 4. storage exposure seed for 2 months then do the germination test (160kv). Test 5 initial germination test for the 140 kv exposure seed. Test 6. storage exposure seed for 2 months then do the germination test (140kv). I will tract the data twice a week and keep observation each day.
