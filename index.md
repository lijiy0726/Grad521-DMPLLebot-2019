# Data description
I'm going to use four datasets in this experiment, and the first dataset is the tz test, germination rate, liner and dry matter content. The second dataset is the physical sample; The third one is the seed pictures of X-ray image and info collected from Eugene airport and cooperated with our engineering department for seed exposure. The last dataset is photograph of each step during the experiment and observation every 15 days of  seed growth.
For dataset 1:
TZ test: using TZ solution to check the seed quality at the beginning of the research. staining occurs in live and healthy portions lead to test the seed viability. 
germination rate: calculate the percentage of germination and identify parts of a germinating seed with different types of genetic seeds (ex. Pear and peach) during each 15 days. I will observe twice a week and record the growth rate and the occurrence of any pathology symptoms
Linear: Measure root length and overall length of seedlings
Dry matter content: cut the embryonic leaf then put in lab oven 24 hours then weight refers to material remaining after removal of water, and the moisture content reflects the amount of water present in the feed ingredient.
For dataset 2:
Collect the physical sample after experiment
For dataset 3: (x-ray pictures & info)
Eugene airport uses a computer tomography (CT) scanner which is a hollow tube that surrounds a box using x-ray to scan the seed.  
We use a customized L10711-19 X-ray source (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan). Creating a Visible image from invisible radiation as the X-ray waves are invisible for the human eye.
For dataset 4:
Photography: take pictures of all the plants in the box every 15 days for comparison to control the environment, temperature and other factors
# Roles and responsibilities
For dataset 1，Grad student 1, Grad student 2 and Undergraduate student 1 as a data collector and data generation for seed quality and germination rate, TZ test, measure the linear, test the dry matter content. For dataset 2: Grad student 1 will collect the physical sample after experiment. For dataset 3: (x-ray pictures & info), Grad student 1 and P1 will go to Eugene airport and cooperate with engineering department to just instrument. For dataset 4: Grad student 1 will take Photography in every step of experiment. After collect the data, Lab assistant 1 and Grad student 1 for data analyzer. Professor 1 is the main project designer; Grad student 1 is responsible for data backup and storage.  Lab assistant 1 is for instrumentation maintenance; Grad student 1 is for data organization; Grad student 1 and professor 1 are for quality control. 
# Data standards and metadata

# Storage and security
I don’t think any of my research data are sensitive because It’s not related to human subjects so don’t need to have protection. For storage, First I will store all of the files relevant to one project under a common root directory. Then put the research project name. As the follow will be chronological organization date and time. I also have a fixed data set, data directory to store the results of the directory tracking calculations performed on experimental data, with each manuscript a doc document directory, pic picture directory in a same file or script of the book. Different research or coursework will put in the different root directory.
